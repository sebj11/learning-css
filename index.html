        <h2>Why Have I Created this Page?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm using this page to test out all the different CSS methods and document them so I have a log of some sorts. The techniiques that are most useful I will apply to my PT website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will be following this <a href="https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA?si=RrRBu9slloEEDpJA">11hour tutotorial</a> on YouTube to help me experiment 
            </p>

            <div>
                <h4>Box Method</h4>
                <p>
                    I've decided to switch up the tutorial and focus on Kevin Powell's video tutorial series - <a href="./pages/kevin-powell-css.html">HTML & CSS for Beginners</a>

        <h3>Rule Specificity Breakdown</h3>

        <!--Tested out inheritance rules using ol and li-->

        <div class="small-italic">Ranking from least specific to most specific:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Universal Selector (*)</li>
            <li>Type Selector (Element Selector) and Pseudo-elements</li>
            <li>Class Selector, Attribute Selector, and Pseudo-classes</li>
            <li>ID Selector</li>
            <li>Inline Styles</li>
            <li>!important</li>
        </ol>
       
        <p>Cascading: If two rules are identical, the one at the bottom of the css page will have higher priority because it is the last to be applied.</p>
       
        <p>Specificity: Overrides all other declarations, regardless of their specificity.</p>

        <p> Using !important forces the style to be applied, ignoring all other specificity rules. However, !important can be overridden by another !important with higher specificity.</p>

        <div class="bold">Useful Tip!</div>
        <div>If you open the page on chrome, right-click, and click 'inspect'. It gives you the CSS breakdown and shows you why some rules are beiing overridden, and the numerical value of the CSS. More on CSS numerical breakdown <a href="./pages/css-number-breakdown.html">here.</a></div>

        <div>
            <p class="small-italic">Example</p>

        <h3>Chapter 1: Intro</h3>
        <p>Nothing to test here, it was just setting everything up. The below isn't part of chapter 1 but I think having a breakdown of the specificity rules is super important</p>



        <h3>Chapter 2: Selectors</h3>
            <h4>Element Selectors</h4>
                <p>Elements are like body, p, h1, etc and it automatically selects all those elements. An interesting one is size in px because even with headers it still increases everything proportionately.</p>
            <h4>Class Selectors</h4>
                <p>These allow you to get more specific. In CSS you create a class with .[text] {style}, then you can apply to the part of the website you want. So in this example I have applied to the h1 and img within the div.</p>
            <h4>ID Selectors</h4>
                <p>This is written in the same way in the stylesheet although with a #. <span id="rarely-use">These should rarely if ever be used!!</span> He has stressed it is bad practice to use these and if you do they should only be used once. I get the sense at this stage that you basically want to style everything with class selectors with the occasional element selector.</p>

            <h5>Grouping Selectors</h5>
                <p>this is really simple, if you to apply the same style to more than one element selector you simply write a , between the two elements that you wish to apply both to. H1 and H2 are used in this example.</p>

            <h5>Selectors within Selectors (I think)</h5>
                <p>Similar to the above, if you remove the comma this time it will only target the element nested within the other element. Ok so the indent doesn't make it nested, one tag actually has to be in the other. In this example I have used this for nav plus the link.</p>

            <h5>Universal selector</h5>
                <p>* Star selector that selects everything, you would never use this apart from a 'CSS reset' which he will go through later.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 3: Colors</h3>

        <h5>Three different types of colours:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li class="color-name">Simply typing the color e.g #darkblue</li>
            <li class="color-rgb">RGB (Red,Green,Black) - each component has a max of 255 and min of 0. So all 0 would be black and all 255 would be white. Whereas 255,0,0 would be red. Also if you add a fourth number that equates to transparancy between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li class="color-hex">Hex - based on a number code - easiest way to do this is to look it up on a separate page</li>
            <li class="color-hsl">If you hover over the color square you can choose from the palette</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="color-contrast">
            <h5>Color Palette</h5>
                <p>HSL (Hue/Saturation/Lightness) - This is if you want to get really advanced with colors. </p>
                <p>Make sure you go on <a href="https://coolors.co/f2ccc3-e78f8e-ffe6e8-acd8aa-f48498">Coolors</a> to generate colour palettes and test contrasts which is really important. For some sort of website standards that assign a numerical value that tells you the contrast between the background and the text and they have minimum scores and tests for this.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chapter 4: Units & Sizes</h3>

        <p>All browsers have default settings, so if you got into Chrome setting you can choose a font size of large, medium, small. This is known as your root settings, and is usually always at 16px. This is known as your root element, and is important for percentages later as percentages will be relative to this number.</p>

        <p class="pixel-22">px = pixels, and it the most common size unit. So whilst you can type font size = large, these are essentially pre-set sizes. If you want more customization then pixels is a good choice.</p>
            
        <p class="pixel-22 color-rgb">It is not recommended to apply a pixel font size for the entire doc (such as * or html selector) because this then overrides the root settings in your chrome browser which is apparently bad</p>

        <h5 class="dashed-border">Percentages</h5>

        <p>The default setting for elements from a width perspective is to use the entirety of the width that's availabe on the page. So a heading element will take up the entire left-right of the page even if the text only takes up a certain amount. See header border for example.</p>

        <p class="fifty-percent">You can use percetage to reduce this width from the default setting. For example, this paragraph is 50%</p>

        <article class="fifty-percent">
            <section class="fifty-percent">If you have a parent, like an article, where the width is set to 50%, and you create a child element, like a section, and set that to 50%, then rule will apply 50% of the 50% (25% of the root)</section>
        </article>

        <div class="two-rem">
            <h5 class="half-em">rem and em</h5>
                <p class="half-em">This is supposedly the best way to apply font sizes. From what I understand, rem = relative to root element. So 1rem would keep the text the same size as the default which is 16px. If you put 2rem then it will double the text size to 32pixels.</p>

                <h5>rem vs em</h5>
                <p>From what I understand, rem always = relative to root (browswer settings). Whereas em means the parent or the selector. So similar to the percentages where you can do 50% of 50%. Em is bascially when you apply size relative to that element, not the root. This is supposed to be great for padding and buttons.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>ch (character)</h5>
        <p class="ch-width">Another way of formatting, so you can use character settings to define columns e.g. width = 40characters</p>
