        <h3>Spacing between elements</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="bold">This all comes down to margin. So if you notice big spaces in between your text block or elements then you can manipulate these by editing the margins. It is common practice to change the margin-bottom and NOT the margin top, otherwise it essentially doubles. This makes it easier to style going from top down. So as you can see from above, I want the h4 to be really close to the p when talking about a different section.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Now we're going to talk about spacing in between the lines in one element, like a p. This is the exact equivalent to the line spacing function on word. The css style for this is line-height, you can do this in pixels but it is recommneded to just use the sane number referencing as in word. So 1 would make it exactly the same size as the text which is quite cramped, 2 would be the equivlant of double spacing which is probably too big. So somewhere within that range works well. For this I've opted for 1.25.</p>
