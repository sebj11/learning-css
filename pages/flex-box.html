        <h3>Flexbox vs Grid</h3>
        <p>These are the two main methods of formatting when it comes to styling html pages on CSS. From what I've gathered through a couple of YouTube Videos, is that Flexbox focuses on the child, so all the content within the div fits around the content. With Grid, everything focuses on the parent, so a bit like excel, it's much more rigid in the way in the way that its structured. Also it seems that a lot of the focus is on how 'responsive' the page is e.g whether it's on desktop, tablet or phone and what happens when you change the size of the window and how it responds to that change in size.</p>
        <h4>Flexbox</h4>
        <p>Flexbox is designed for laying out items in a single direction (either as a row or a column). Itâ€™s great for one-dimensional layouts.</p>
        <h4>Grid</h4>
        <p>CSS Grid is designed for creating more complex, two-dimensional layouts. It lets you work with both rows and columns at the same time.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When beginning the layout, focus on killing as many bird with one stone as possible. So essentially focus on the fundamentals like font, colours, background, padding, margin etc. first.</li>
            <li>Avoid fixed sizes e.g 100pixels - set min and max width and heights instead. And use ems and rems over pixels (rewatch the 11hour video on the rems and ems section).</li>
            <li>Most developers don't like horizontal scroll bars</li>
        </ul>
